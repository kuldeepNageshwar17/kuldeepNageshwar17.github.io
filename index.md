# Hi there! 👋

I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 7+ years of experience delivering large-scale applications and modern GenAI products. I build end-to-end systems—from architecture and APIs to MCP-based agents and RAG pipelines—that ship reliably to production.

## 🔧 Technical Skills

- **Front-End**: React.js – Build scalable, maintainable UIs with design systems and performance budgets
- **Back-End**: Python, .NET Core, Node.js – Strong in RESTful APIs, event-driven services, and database design
- **GenAI**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) apps, RAG pipelines, vector search (Pinecone/PGVector), guardrails, evaluation, and latency/quality tuning
- **Mobile**: GenAI-first mobile experiences with responsive UX and offline-aware flows
- **Database**: Relational and NoSQL, schema design, indexing, and performance profiling
- **DevOps**: Azure DevOps, Docker, CI/CD – Automated testing, deployment, and server management
- **Cloud**: AWS, Google Cloud – Production-grade deployments, cost/perf optimization
- **Tools**: GitHub, GitLab, Linux server, Git – Efficient in version control and team workflows

## 🌐 Domains & Projects

I’ve worked across **education, fitness, learning, data platforms, and applied GenAI**, often contributing to large-scale projects with teams averaging 15 members. Highlights:

- Built MCP-based agents that orchestrate tools and APIs for enterprise workflows
- Shipped RAG systems with vector search, retrieval tuning, and automated evaluation loops
- Maintained large React codebases with design systems and accessibility standards
- Implemented robust back-end services in .NET Core and Python, including observability and SLOs
- Designed and managed CI/CD pipelines to keep releases fast and reliable
- Delivered full-stack solutions independently from concept to production with measurable impact
